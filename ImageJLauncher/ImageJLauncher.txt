Author: George H. Silva <George_Silva at chemie_bio_uni-giessen_de>

Requires: ImageJ 1.35j or later

Version History:
    v1.0.0.x - 2006/1/21 - initial release
             - Basic code based on "The Java launcher for Windows v1.22" by Jacob Marner
             - Improved/customized for ImageJ (i.e. can handle file-associations, etc)
             - This windows stub can be used for other Java applications as well;
               just change the icon, set the DEF_CFG constant and re-compile!

    v1.1.0.x - 2006/1/23 - many updates/improvements
             - Robust loader to handle various config scenarios
             - Code to auto-create the config file
             - Code for auto-detection of various parameters (JVM, mem usage, etc)
             - Code to allow selection of needed files
             - This version essentially can reconfigure itself as needed, depending
               on how the user changes their JAVA install

    v1.2.0.x - 2006/1/24 - minor updates/improvements
             - Bug fixes and logic changes per Wayne's suggestions

    v1.3.0.x - 2006/1/24 - minor updates/improvements
             - Correctly expands command-line params to full-paths as needed
             - Preserves relative path for JRE if possible
             - No longer needlessly expands relative paths and re-saves CFG file
             - Improved logic to make sure tools.jar is in JVM params

    v1.4.0.x - 2006/1/25 - major updates/improvements
             - Undo command-line expansion bug
             - Supports all forms of ImageJ execution - all paths, params, etc
             - Improved logic for adjusting JVM parameters

    v1.4.1.x - 2006/1/31 - minor updates/improvements
             - New default for setting memory parameter
             - Additional feedback added for failure situations

    v1.4.2.x - 2006/2/1 - minor updates/improvements
             - Fixed OpenDilaog code to work with older Win9x systems

    v1.4.3.x - 2006/2/1 - Changed File Description to: "ImageJ Launcher"


Installation:

Copy the ImageJ.exe file to your ImageJ installation folder, overwriting the
exisiting one. If you want to reconfigure your JVM (including getting the compile
feature to work IF YOU HAVE THE JDK), just delete/rename your current ImageJ.cfg
file and start the program.


Source code:

Delphi Pascal source code is included - feel free to modify/improve/change the code
for your own purposes. I wrote/compiled this with Delphi v6, so it should run and be
code-compatible with all exisiting versions of Windows from Win95 and up. The original
C-source on which I based this code can be found at:

http://www.rolemaker.dk/nonRoleMaker/javalauncher/marner_java_launcher.htm

The program functionality was maintained as is to provide compatibility with previous
ImageJ installations. Improvemens include properly handling file-associations to launch
ImageJ, being able to generate/re-config ImageJ and (hopefully) a bullet-proof loader
that can handle any configuration changes in terms of JAVA or ImageJ. Enjoy!

Any suggestions/comments/requests are welcome.
